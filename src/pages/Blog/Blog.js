                <h1>What are the differences between javascript and nodejs?</h1>
                <p>JavaScript and Node.js are both programming languages, but they are used in different ways.

                JavaScript is a programming language that is primarily used to create interactive front-end web applications. It is mainly used to create dynamic effects on a web page, such as form validation, image sliders, and interactive maps.

                Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side, which means you can use JavaScript to create back-end web applications, command-line tools, and other server-side scripts. Node.js also provides an extensive library of modules that simplify common tasks such as file I/O, networking, and database operations.

                In short, JavaScript is a programming language and Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side.</p>



                <h1>When should you use nodejs and when should you use mongodb?</h1>
                <p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side, while MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is used to store and retrieve data.

                You should use Node.js when you want to build a server-side web application and you want to use JavaScript as your programming language. Node.js has a large and active community, and it provides a wide range of modules and frameworks to make it easy to create web applications. Node.js is suitable for building real-time web applications, APIs, and microservices.

                You should use MongoDB when you need a scalable and high-performance database that can handle large amounts of unstructured data. MongoDB is a NoSQL database which means it stores data in a format that is different from traditional relational databases. MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means it stores data in a format called BSON (Binary JSON) and it is easy to use with Node.js. MongoDB is suitable for use cases such as content management, real-time analytics, and personalization.

                In summary, Node.js and MongoDB are often used together in web applications, but they serve different purposes. Node.js is for building the server-side logic and handling HTTP requests, while MongoDB is for storing and retrieving data.</p>


                <h1>What are the differences between sql and nosql databases?</h1>
                <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) databases and NoSQL databases are both types of databases, but they have some key differences in how they store and manage data.

                Data Structure: SQL databases use a structured data model, which means that data is stored in tables with a fixed schema. Each table has a defined set of columns and data must be stored in a specific format. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, use a flexible, unstructured data model. Data can be stored in a variety of formats, such as JSON or BSON, and it does not have to adhere to a fixed schema.

                Data relationships: SQL databases use a relational model, which means that data is organized into tables with defined relationships between them. NoSQL databases do not have the same concept of relationships between tables. Instead, data is often embedded within documents, or linked through references or keys.

                Query language: SQL databases use a declarative query language (SQL) which is used to retrieve and manipulate data. NoSQL databases often have their own query languages, and they may also support SQL-like query languages such as MongoDB's query language.

                Scalability: SQL databases are designed to scale vertically, which means that they can handle more load by adding more resources to a single server. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are designed to scale horizontally, which means that they can handle more load by adding more servers to a cluster.

                Performance: SQL databases are optimized for complex, multi-table joins and transactional workloads. NoSQL databases are optimized for read and write performance, they perform well in scenarios that require high write and read throughput.

                Use cases: SQL databases are best suited for applications that require complex queries, transactions and ACID compliance. NoSQL databases are best suited for applications that require high scalability, flexibility and high write/read performance.

                In summary, both SQL and NoSQL databases have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice of database depends on the specific requirements of the application.</p>


                <h1>What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work?</h1>
                <p>JWT (JSON Web Token) is a standard for representing claims securely between two parties. It is often used to authenticate users in web applications and APIs.

                The purpose of JWT is to provide a secure way of transmitting information between parties. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed using a secret key. This means that the information contained in a JWT cannot be tampered with, because any changes to the data would cause the signature to be invalid.

                JWT works by encoding a JSON object, which contains the claims, into a string. This string is then signed using a secret key. The resulting JWT can then be sent to the other party in an HTTP header or as a query parameter. The other party can then decode the JWT and verify its signature using the same secret key.

                Here is an example of how JWT works:

                A user logs into a web application and provides their credentials (username and password).

                The web application verifies the credentials and creates a JWT that contains the user's ID and other claims such as the expiration time.

                The web application sends the JWT to the user in the HTTP response.

                The user sends the JWT back to the web application in each subsequent request, in the HTTP header or as a query parameter.

                The web application verifies the signature of the JWT and extracts the user's ID and other claims.

                The web application uses the user's ID to retrieve the user's information from the database and grants access to the protected resources.

                In summary, JWT is a JSON-based standard for creating secure tokens that can be shared between parties to authenticate users and share information. It provides a simple and secure way to transmit information between parties and can be used for authentication and authorization in web applications and APIs.</p>
